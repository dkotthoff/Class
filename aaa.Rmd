In the first week I learned about bias-variance tradeoff and basic formatting in markdown. 

For the second week I learned about using visualization to look at and organize data, as well as transforming data into more useful variables.

Linear regression and MSE were the main topics of week 3.

Week 4 had us looking at logistic regression and confusion matrices.

I studied GLMS in week 5, learning about poisson regression and gamma regression.

Trees were brought in during week 6, where I learned about random forests and decision trees.

Clustering was the interest of week 7, where we covered not only the idea behind clustering but also how to select the optimal number of clusters.

The final week was about presenting and documenting data.
